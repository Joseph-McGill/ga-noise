## The Effects of Noise on Genetic Algorithm Solution Quality

This project studies the effects of noise on genetic algorithm solution
quality using two selection strategies: tournament selection and rank-based
roulette wheel selection. The genetic algorithm runs on multiple
[Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) instances with varying city counts. Noise is generated using a normal
distribution and is added during the selection process. The results can be seen
in the [figures](../master/figures) directory.
